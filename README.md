-Find where is Dimtable where is Facttable

-Find which formula is necessary 

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a measure table by DAX 

-Measure about quanlity, scrap, unsafe_product, value

-Create a ouline 

-Choose chart or card to show the change or display indicators

## üìä Key Insights & Visualizations  

### üîç Dashboard Preview  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard 1 Preview 

- Observation: Dashboard 1 provides an overview of scrap with key metrics like Total Orders (5M), Total Scrap (1K), Scrap Value ($2.8M), and Scrap Rate (0.24%). It also highlights trends with the Top 5 locations with the highest scrap (e.g., Subassembly, Final Assembly) and Top 5 scrap products (e.g., Fork End, Seat Stays). ML Crankset was a highest product scrap especially in Jun 2012 and July 2013, total scrap was 225 and highest in 20133 with 139 and the common reason scrap was Thermoform temperature too low, color incorrect . 

- Recommendation: Need to re-check the machinery system and assembly team at the final assembly stage, especially for the ML crankset product when this product alone has a deficit of $25.6K

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard 2 Preview  

-Observation: Dashboard 2 focuses on detailed scrap analysis, showing Total Scrap by FinishedGoodsFlag (20.08K), Scrap Rate by Class (28.28% H, 37.95% M, 33.76% L), and Scrap Value per Location (peaking at $153K at Final Assembly). Trends in scrap quantity and value fluctuate (0K-2K), highlighting Final Assembly and Finished Goods Storage as areas to monitor. 

-Recommendation: Scrap products leading to cost deficits usually occur from late June to September, which is the peak season for sales due to the summer and requires additional staffing during this time, as well as increased process monitoring and inspection, especially in the final assembly area, where $166K has been spent. At the same time, focus more on class M because this is a popular segment with many buyers, but it is noted that this product also has many errors due to the reason Thermoform temperature too low.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard 3 Preview

-Observation: Dashboard 3 focuses on inventory risk, showing Safety Stock (974), UnsafeProductValue ($4.66M), and distribution by location (Subassembly $2.4M, Finished Goods $2.3M). Trends indicate high unsafe products at Subassembly, requiring attention

-Recommendation: Road-150 Red, 44 at Final Assembly which has unsafe value highest can be the potential to threaten revenue, need to review or eliminate this product to avoid unnecessary loss or optimize, redesign the product

## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations  

üìå Key Takeaways:

1.üîß Subassembly and Final Assembly are key defect points, with higher scrap rates due to inadequate inline inspection and inconsistent operator performance.

2.üì¶ Unsafe inventory levels are high, especially at Subassembly and Finished Goods Storage, indicating poor quality segregation and delayed decisions.

3.üß© Certain parts‚Äîsuch as Fork End, Seat Stays, and Crank Sets‚Äîshow up repeatedly in high-loss reports, suggesting chronic quality issues.

4.üè≠ Some production lines or areas have disproportionately higher rejection rates, often due to outdated processes or lack of root cause feedback loops.

5.üìä Current dashboards mostly show surface-level trends; deeper analysis by defect reason, time, and region is essential for true problem solving.

6.üí∏ High-cost product classes (Class M & L) are contributing significantly to financial losses when rejected, creating a mismatch between quality risk and production value.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations:

1. Deploy automated inspection at Subassembly and Final Assembly
Introduce AI-vision systems or sensor-based checks to identify defects early and reduce dependence on manual inspection.

2. Strengthen inventory management of unsafe and pending items
Set up clear inventory segregation rules, frequent re-check intervals, and apply forecasting models to avoid overstocking or aging quality holds.

3. Deep-dive into high-loss components like Fork End, Seat Stays
Use historical rejection data and defect reason tagging to identify failure modes and redesign or retrain processes accordingly.

4. Implement location-based quality tracking
Break down rejection and loss data by factory zone/line to spot problematic areas, and implement zone-specific SOPs or operator training.

5. Introduce a dynamic loss-cost dashboard
Go beyond quantity metrics‚Äîtrack actual financial loss per product category, by region and supplier, to prioritize where to act for best ROI.

6. Align production planning with quality risk
Reduce production load on lines that frequently produce high-defect products, or shift complex items to better-performing zones.
